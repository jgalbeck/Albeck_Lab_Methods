# Imaging Experiment platemap example
Uploaded example of imaging experiment platemap used for every experiment performed by the Albeck Lab. 
When creating versions for experiments to be used with the Albeck lab data analysis pipeline:
1. File names should begin with YYYY-MM-DD
2. The file name should match the name of the .nd2 file the platemap is associated with.
3. A new file should be created for every experiment ran, even if it is a repeat of previous experiments.
